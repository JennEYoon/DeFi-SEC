#  Create and save jupyter notebooks here.

#### Update 10/19/2019 - create test notebook.  

 * Jupyter notebook with 3d projection plot. 
   - GITHUB does NOT render any of the 3D projection notebooks today.
   - Check back later.  I think it worked before.  Github temporary issue?  
   - Uploaded ipython checkpoints, but still does not render any of the 3 notebookd for 3D projections. 
   - 10/21/2019 2:48 PM. 
 * Update 10/24/2019 1:17 AM  
    - None of the 3 Jupyter notebooks with 3D projection are rendering.  
    - Create 2D and 3D by itself (not in a row) and try again.  
    - Still don't work.  Only 2d and try again.
