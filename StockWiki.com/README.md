# StockWiki.com Development     

Focus on retail investor for StockWiki -- similar to SeekingAlpha, MintMoney, MotlyFools.  

This repo will remain public to showcase my development process.  Functions as a programming and web development portfolio.  
Use HTML5, CSS3, javascript, and Bootstrap Framework.  Also use Amazon Aurora for MySQL. (Postgres seem to have minimum machine set as t2.  No free layer available.)  Also research React/Preact and Vue frameworks.  

## Date Started: Nov 26, 2019  

## Author: Jennifer E. Yoon  

## Goal: To have a live website by March, 15, 2020 (Ides of March).


### Next Actions:  

 * Create a 1-page website for StockWiki.  
 * Add Bootstrap Framework. Watch tutorials.    

-----------------------------------------------------  

## Ideas  

###  Idea 1 - AWS Aurora database hookup  

Use it to showcase my SQL skills.  Use MySQL or Prosgres SQL.  
Use stock data for 5000 stocks, past 30 years or to max.  
Initally - do 20 stocks I am interested in.   

Some sort of charts and analysis using stock data.  
Energy Trading data from EIA.gov.  
Plotly interactive charts.  

### Idea 2 -- Look for ML and DL in Finance & Trading.  

 * ML models -- decision trees, random forest, k-means clustering, PCA dimensionality reduction (economic and interest rate data), svm. 
 * Deep Learning -- use shortcuts and clobber together other people's models and use on stock data. NLP and text. CNN on face recognition.  

**Trend Analysis:**
 * Google search term trends  
 * Earning call buy/hold/sell -- aggregation and individual  (NLP?)
 * Volumne data  
 * Insider buy/sell data  
 * Float percentage outstanding -- out of total issued shares.  
   
### Idea 3 -- Python code for Option Pricing Model  

 * Use Python for Finance book -- code examples  
 * Do a generic one for dividend paying American Option.  
 * Extend to WTI and Brent futures, option, swaption.  
 * Compare to history & spot prices.   
   
### Idea 4 - Credit Rating Recommendation model, CDO pricing model.    

 * Use Credit Cards data  
 * Use CDO modeling, get data from somewhere.  Hull Risk book.  
 * Use FINRA TRACE credit transition matrix  
 * Look at Edgar Online -- see credit rating trasition data is availble during development, not for commercial use later.  
 
### Idea 5 -- tie in Geospatial Economic Analysis  
 
 * Mapping using geosnap, geopandas, pysal.  
 * Macro Economic data from FED, World Bank, etc.  
 
 ### Idea 6 - Fundamental Stock Value analysis & Narrative Company WIKI.   
 
  * Get data from SEC Edgar - source.  
  * Compare with Edgar Online SEC Edgar data -- scrape to test.  
  * Write Wikis on top banks.  Suppliment with public data from Wikipedia.  

### Other Ideas:  

 * AOTH -- user account creation.
 * Bootstrap Framework
 * Learn a lit about Javascript, React & Preact, Vue.  
 * Add shopping cart and sell Merch?  Embroidered math symbols on iron-on pockets.
