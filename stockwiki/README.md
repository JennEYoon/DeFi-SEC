## Ideas  

###  Idea 1 - AWS Aurora database hookup  

Use it to showcase my SQL skills.  Use MySQL or Prosgres SQL.  
Use stock data for 5000 stocks, past 30 years or to max.
Initally - do 20 stocks I am interested in.  

###  Idea 2 - Add trend analysis using NLP  

 * Google search term trends  
 * Earning call buy/hold/sell -- aggregation and individual  
 * Volumne data  
 * Insider buy/sell data  
 * Float percentage outstanding -- out of total issued shares.  
 
### Idea 3 - Credit Rating Recommendation & Predition model  

 * Use Credit Cards data  
 * Use FINRA TRACE transition matrix  
 * Look at Edgar Online -- see if any data can be scrapted for one-time use.  
 
 ### Idea 4 - Fundamental Stock Value analysis  
 
  * Get data from SEC Edgar - source.  
  * Compare with Edgar Online SEC Edgar data -- scrape to test.  
  
### Idea 5 -- Python code for Option Pricing Model  

 * Use Python for Finance book -- code examples  
 * Do a generic one for dividend paying American Option.
