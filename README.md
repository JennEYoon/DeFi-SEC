# SEC-data, public repo  
My Python machine learning project using SEC-data (U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission) in finance, investing and derivatives.

***Note: Renamed "master" to "main" branch in support of Black Lives Matter, June 2020***

#### Author: Jennifer E. Yoon  

#### Description:  

My goal is to provide examples of using Machine Learning on SEC data and financial derivatives and economics data more generally.  I use Python and its data science libraries, i.e., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and Scikit-Learn.  I use the Jupyter Notebook as my interface for showing code.  Some projects from here are showcased at my data science website, **http://datasciY.com/projects.html** .

My earlier projects will focus on visualization using various Python graphics libraries.  My later projects will focus on applying commonly used Machine Learning methods to datasets from the financial industry.  

#### History:

 * Updated Inequality data from US Census and Department of Labor  
 * Created Issue #1 Inequality Docs.  
 * June 2020 - rename "master" to "main" default branch.  
 * Oct 2020 Made public again. 
 * 10/27/2020 -- move out more private files.
