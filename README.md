Decentralized Finance and SEC Regulations.

#### Author: Jennifer E. Yoon  

#### Description:  

I repurposed this repo for studying the "DeFi" market, decentralized finance and SEC Regulations.  

I use Python and its data science libraries, i.e., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and Scikit-Learn.  I use the Jupyter Notebook as my interface for showing code.  Some projects from here are showcased at my data science website, **http://datasciY.com/projects.html** .
