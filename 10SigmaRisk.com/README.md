### Description:  

This is my backup plan in case I am having difficulty getting a job as a Data Scientist or the job search is taking too long.  Revamp my Financial Risk Management website.  Look for new clients.  How they can use machine learning and deep learning to manage their portfolio.  How they can use web-based visualization to market to new investors or clients.
