# My reading notes from Capital in 21 Century book

May-June reading. Also have audible, but need to refer to charts often.  

#### July 10, 2020 commentary:  

Enjoyed happy hour networking, but may have talked a little too much.  
Anyway, I probably got more out of it than anyone else. :-P  
Connect with Thomas and try to contribute to Spring SKLearn this weekend, maybe a documentation edit. :-P  

 * Make a list of all the ways ML/DS is used in finance & trading.  
   - provide some examples on my website for 10 Sigma Risk, offer to work as freelance on these projects. 
   - write personal evaluation of usefulness, impact of each application of ML to finance.  
   
 * PySAL and geosnap -- try to contribute something, documentation or example First Issue, if they have one.    
 * Apologize to Eli, and ask him to delete my previous PR attempt. Since it failed, wink.
