# My reading notes from Capital in 21 Century book

May-June reading. Also have audible, but need to refer to charts often.  

#### July 10, 2020 commentary:  

Enjoyed happy hour networking, but may have talked a little too much.  
Anyway, I probably got more out of it than anyone else. :-P  
Connect with Thomas and try to contribute to Spring SKLearn this weekend, maybe a documentation edit. :-P
