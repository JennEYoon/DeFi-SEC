# New Idea: Blog for Traders, StockWiki.com  

Date: Nov 18, 2019  

While reviewing Ken Nicholas's AI-Trading business idea, I had the thought that what is missing is an easy way to blog about trading ideas without the restriction of "copyrighted" data and "copyrighted" charts and analytics that Bloomberg and other providers impose.  I proposed this idea to Ken as the primary focus of his initial release.  But he doesn't seem too keen on it.  So I can do this myself without worrying about Ken.  It was my idea anyway.  Ken has not developed or will he execute on it in the near future.

Traders like to boast about their killer winning trades, and even gripe about their biggest busted trades.  Right now, it's almost impossible to write about it on a public blog without a subscription to an expensive source.  

Need to do more research.  Does Medium allow blogs?  Look again at user agreements, copyrigts at Bloomberg and Yahoo Finance, etc.  

Hook up AWS-database to downloaded free data.  Create stand-alone templates with good looking graphs and layout with impages using standard sizing.  Text flow nicely. Font kernelling.  

I like Ken's idea of hooking up simple ML algos to use as trading strategy.  I may have Google trendline graphs and other ways to use ML in trading.  

Later add WIKI style information about individual stocks that I like to follow, and Users can do the same.  SO it will be in keeping with the name, StockWiki, a Wiki about Stocks and investing. :-)
