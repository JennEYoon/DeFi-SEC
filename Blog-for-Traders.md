# New Idea: Blog for Traders, StockWiki.com  

Date: Nov 18, 2019  

While reviewing Ken Nicholas's AI-Trading business idea, I had the thought that what is missing is an easy way to blog about trading ideas without the restriction of "copyrighted" data and "copyrighted" charts and analytics that Bloomberg and other providers impose.  

Traders like to boast about their killer winning trades, and even gripe about their biggest busted trades.  Right now, it's almost impossible to write about it on a public blog without a subscription to an expensive source.  

Need to do more research.  Does Medium allow blogs?  Look again at user agreements, copyrigts at Bloomberg and Yahoo Finance, etc.  

Hook up AWS-database to downloaded free data.  Create stand-alone templates with good looking graphs and layout with impages using standard sizing.  Text flow nicely. Font kernelling.
