#### Asians earned more at highest, lowest, and middle earnings levels    

Asian men who worked full time had median weekly earnings of $1,080 in 2014. That compares with medians of $897 for White men, $680 for Black or African American men, and $616 for Hispanic or Latino men. Median earnings for Asian women were $841 per week in 2014; the median was $734 for White women, $611 for Black or African American women, and $548 for Hispanic or Latino women.Among the highest paid 10 percent of workers (those at or above the 90th wage percentile), Asian men earned the most: $2,560 or more per week in 2014. By comparison, the highest paid 10 percent of White men earned $2,120 or more per week, the highest paid Black or African American men earned $1,534 or more, and the highest paid Hispanic or Latino men earned $1,468 or more. For women in the highest paid 10 percent, the pattern was similar: Asian women earned the most, followed by White women, Black or African American women, and Hispanic or Latino women.  


#### College graduates earn nearly twice as much as high school graduates at the highest paid level  

People age 25 or older with at least a bachelor’s degree have higher median earnings than people with less education. In 2014, median weekly earnings of full-time workers with at least a bachelor’s degree were $1,193. That compares with a median of $761 for full-time workers with some college or an associate degree and $668 for workers with a high school diploma who had never enrolled in college. Among the highest paid 10 percent (those at or above the 90th earnings percentile), full-time workers with at least a bachelor’s degree earned $2,619 per week in 2014. That compares with $1,560 per week for workers with some college or an associate degree, and $1,355 per week for high school graduates.Workers with more education often have higher earnings, but earnings vary within every education level. As a result, some workers with less education have higher earnings than some workers with more education. For example, the highest paid 10 percent of high school graduates (those at or above the 90th percentile), earned about 14 percent more per week in 2014 than did college graduates at or above the median (50th percentile).The range of earnings was greater in 2014 for college graduates than for workers with less education. Among full-time workers with at least a bachelor’s degree, the ratio of the 90th earnings percentile to the 10th percentile was 4.5. That compares with a 90–10 ratio of 3.9 among workers with some college or an associate degree and 3.7 for high school graduates.  

High School only graduates seem to earn plenty at the 90th percentile, although not as much as college + graduates.

#### Information industry has largest wage gap from highest to lowest  

Industry wage ratios help identify how pay varies within industries. The highest paid 10 percent of workers in the information industry earned nearly 6 times as much as the lowest paid 10 percent, with a 90–10 ratio of 5.8. Information includes several smaller industries: publishing, broadcasting, telecommunications, data processing, and motion picture and sound recording. Finance and insurance, management of companies and enterprises, and professional, scientific, and technical services all had 90–10 wage ratios above 5.0 in May 2014.Accommodation and food services had a 90–10 wage ratio of 2.1.This means the difference in pay between the highest and lowest paid workers was smallest in this industry. Retail trade and agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting both had 90–10 ratios below 3.0 in May 2014. 

Sees that any sector that is highest paying, have more gaps than sectors that are not high paying.  Finance & Insurance is not widest gap, maybe if investment bankers are split out, it will be much wider gap.
